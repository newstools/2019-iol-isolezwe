I worked with David for years on SABC Sport, where he was a wonderful analyst. He would joke we were twins - both named David, both born on 2 November and both married to white women. #RIPDavidKekana We will always remember you! #RIPDavidKekana pic.twitter.com/1uayVq2V3n #RIPDavidKekana heâ€™s laughter was his signature ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­How heâ€™d laugh so hard on Shampoos Joke with BBKðŸ˜“Lala uphumule qhawe, siyabonga ngempilo yakho ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ pic.twitter.com/2RVlEaadol
