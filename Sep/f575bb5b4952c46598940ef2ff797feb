The hawks were very quick to deal with this guy. Very suprising that they are not using the same energy to deal with politicians stealing from the poor. #SamMshengu #samholdings So the Hawks as well as the government are seriously gonna turn a blind eye on the drug dealings in Gauteng & focus on Sam Holdings, someone who is running a legitimate business in SA, paying his taxes and not killing the youth of SA with drugs Kanti nisebenza njani?#samholdings pic.twitter.com/Jtf0ejQWDL I cant believe jus like that Sam Holdings has been arrested, it true when they say enjoy your riches in silence you don't need to announce your riches to the whole world. Not everyone is happy when one succeeds #SamHoldings pic.twitter.com/GQ6zPxK2Iz
